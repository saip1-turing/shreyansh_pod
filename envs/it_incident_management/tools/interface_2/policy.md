# Incident Management Policy

## Introduction
This document defines the operational guide for an incident management automation agent.  
It is designed for single-turn execution: each procedure must be self-contained and completed in one interaction.

## SOPs
These Standard Operating Procedures provide structured workflows for managing incidents.  
Each procedure defines clear steps, role-based permissions, and validation requirements to ensure consistent incident handling and resolution.
