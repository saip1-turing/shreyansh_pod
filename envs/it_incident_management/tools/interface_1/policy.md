# Incident Management Policy

## Introduction
This document defines the operational guide for an incident management automation agent.  
It is designed for single-turn execution: each procedure must be self-contained and completed in one interaction.

## SOPs
These Standard Operating Procedures provide structured workflows for managing incidents.  
Each procedure defines clear steps, role-based permissions, and validation requirements to ensure consistent incident handling and resolution.

## Incident Operations

### Creating Incidents
When to use: When service impacts are detected requiring formal incident management response.  
Who can perform: Incident managers, technical support, and system administrators, 3rd party vendors (vendor_contact), executive  
Pre-checks:
- Check that reporter user exists and has active status
- Verify client exists
- Check that component exists if specified

Steps:
- Collect incident title, category, severity, and impact level
- Set detection timestamp
- Associate with specified client and infrastructure component records
- Create incident record and return incident identifier

#### Severity Classification Process during Incident Creation:  
Evaluate the following conditions and set the corresponding boolean flags (`p1_*`, `p2_*`, `p3_*`) to **True** for every condition that applies based on the available data. Compute severity as **P1** if any P1 condition is `True`; otherwise **P2** if any P2 condition is `True`; otherwise **P3** if any P3 condition is `True`; otherwise **P4**.

**P1 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes complete outage of business-critical service with no workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts the entire enterprise or multiple customers with 5 or more affected parties.
- Evaluate whether the incident has significant regulatory, safety, or financial implications.
- Evaluate whether the incident involves a high-priority customer with contractual P1 requirements or is a recurrent incident.

**P2 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident causes major degradation of business-critical services with a workaround available.
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts multiple departments, sites, or critical business functions.
- Evaluate whether the incident risks breaching a high-priority SLA with significant impact.

**P3 Evaluation:**
- Evaluate whether the incident impacts a single department, localized users, or a non-critical function.
- Evaluate whether the incident causes moderate degradation with operations continuing using a minimal workaround.

If none of the P1/P2/P3 conditions apply, set severity as **P4**.

- Set detection timestamp and initial status as open  
- Associate with specified client and reporter.  
- Create incident record with determined severity level and return incident identifier


## Client Management Operations

### Creating Client Records
When to use: When registering new enterprise, mid-market, small business, or startup clients requiring incident management services.  
Who can perform: Account managers, system administrators  
Pre-checks:
- Verify client registration number is unique by checking existing client records
- Check that contact email is not already used by another client

Steps:
- Collect complete client information including name, registration number, contact details, and client type
- Check for existing records with same registration number or email
- Set initial status as active unless user specifies otherwise
- Create client record
- Return client identifier and successful creation flag if client was created 

### Updating Client Information
When to use: When client details change or status modifications are required.  
Who can perform: Account managers and system administrators  
Pre-checks:
- Verify client record exists
- Check user has permission to modify this client's information based on their role and client association
- Confirm new registration number or email is unique if being changed

Steps:
- Retrieve current client record
- Collect specific fields requiring updates
- Apply the changes requested
- Return successful creation flag if client information was updated

## User Management Operations

### Creating User Accounts
When to use: When adding personnel to the incident management system.  
Who can perform: System administrators and incident managers  
Pre-checks: 
- Check that email address is unique
- Verify all required fields are provided by user
- Confirm client or vendor exists if association is specified

Steps:
- Acquire complete user information including name, email, role, and department
- Check for existing records with same email address, users should have unique email
- Associate user with specified client or vendor if provided
- Set status as active 
- Create user record and return user identifier

### Managing User Permissions
When to use: When modifying user access levels or role assignments.  
Who can perform: System administrators and incident managers  
Pre-checks:
- Verify user record exists
- Check requesting user has authority based on role (system administrators, incident managers only)
- Confirm new role value exists in allowed enumeration

Steps:
- Retrieve current user record
- Collect specific role or status changes needed
- Check that new role assignment is valid 
- Apply updates with modifier identification
- Return updated user record and confirm changes saved

## Vendor Management Operations

### Registering Vendor Information
When to use: When adding external service providers to the incident management ecosystem.  
Who can perform: System administrators, incident managers, and executives.  
Pre-checks:
- Check that vendor name, contact phone and emails are unique
- Verify all required fields are provided
- Confirm vendor type exists in allowed enumeration values

Steps:
- Acquire vendor details including name, type, and contact information
- Check for existing records with same vendor name
- Set status as active unless user specifies otherwise
- Create vendor record
- Return vendor identifier and confirm successful creation

## Authority and Access Controls

### Permission Validation
All operations verify user authority based on:
- Role field (incident_manager, technical_support, account_manager, executive, vendor_contact, system_administrator, client_contact)
- Client association through client_id field
- Vendor association through vendor_id field
- Active status in user table
