This interface manages team membership, organizational departments, and department-level structure.

- Each team must belong to a valid organization and have a clear description and name.
- Workers can only belong to one department at a time.
- Changes in department must update the departmentâ€™s manager and worker list.
- Membership records must show join and leave dates and must be explicitly confirmed.

## Limitations
- You may not assign users to non-existent teams or departments.
- Department managers must be active users.
- Users cannot join the same team more than once unless their previous membership ended.
