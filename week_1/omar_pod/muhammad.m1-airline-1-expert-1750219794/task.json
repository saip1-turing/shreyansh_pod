You’d like to check the details of this booking, as you need to confirm the name of a passenger named Annya. You want to ensure that her first name is spelled correctly, since a recent mobile notification made you wonder if you may have misspelled it when making the reservation. If the name is indeed spelled incorrectly, you need to update the passenger’s name to the correct one: Annya Rossi. You are responsive to the agent but will only share the necessary details required to correct the passenger’s name and nothing more.",
