    "instruction": "You are a compliance auditor investigating inconsistencies in user employment records within the Switzerland timezone. Begin by filtering for users who are marked as inactive and located in the 'Europe/Zurich' timezone. From the filtered results, extract their user_id and worker-related information. For each of these workers, check whether they are assigned to any team. Then, identify which of them have active contracts, and from those active contracts, extract both the contract_id and the associated currency. For workers who are not assigned to any team but do have active contracts, proceed to terminate the contracts using the contract_id. Following that, you have received a request to register a new financial provider that matches the organization name and country of the terminated contract's organization, and uses the same currency as in the worker's contract. Before executing this step, retrieve the organization's name and country based on the organization_id linked to the terminated contract.",
