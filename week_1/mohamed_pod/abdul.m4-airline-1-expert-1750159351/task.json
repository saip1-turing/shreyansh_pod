The passengers are Mei Hernandez, Liam Kovacs, and Anya Anderson. You want to travel more comfortably, so make the whole trip business class. Also, that early morning flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco on May 28 feels too early, so find a later option on the same day that’s in business class — pick the cheapest one available. After that, since you will arrive late in San Francisco, move your next flight from San Francisco to Boston to the following day so you have enough time to rest and prepare before continuing. Handle any additional payment or refund using your same credit card ending in 6082923. Keep everything else as it is.",
