You've been informed that there's an organisation based in Montserrat that may need a new contractor. You don't have the organisation's ID, but you know that their name ends with 'Gray' and that they've a team whose name starts with 'Revolutionize'. If this team has fewer than 5 active members, you want to add a contractor to it as the lead. His worker ID is 'a0af6f35-5d33-4b25-b4d7-0ce0d6ed2466' and his joining date should be 10th July, 2025. However, before you reassign this contractor, you want to add 12 hours to his payroll for the time he will spend on handing over his current assignment to his replacement. You also want to see his financial summary to ensure his payroll is in order.",
