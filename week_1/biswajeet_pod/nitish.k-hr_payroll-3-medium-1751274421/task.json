A key employee, 'Brian Wright' with user id '584ff1c5-b542-4902-a541-13ab75b948a3', is departing the company, and you need to process his financial offboarding. You need to ensure that he is active in the organization before you proceed with anything. If not, then discontinue the process. If yes, then you must terminate his contract. But first, you need to pay him for the last 63 hours that he worked after knowing his hourly rate. An invoice should be issued for this work with the due date set to 5th July 2025. Second, you need to process his final expense reimbursement request of 350 for 'Final travel expenses'.",
