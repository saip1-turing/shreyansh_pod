A key employee, 'Daniel Garrett', is departing the company, and you need to process his financial offboarding. First, find him in the list of active workers for your organization to begin. Using his worker ID, retrieve his contract summary to find his active contract details. Then, use that contract ID to create a final invoice for his severance pay of $7000, due today. After that's done, you must terminate his contract. In parallel with the contract actions, please process his final expense reimbursement request for $350 for 'Final travel expenses'.",
