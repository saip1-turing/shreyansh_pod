A key employee, 'Dylan Arellano', is departing the company, and you need to process his financial offboarding. First, find him in the list of active workers for your organization to begin. Using his worker ID, retrieve his contract summary to find his active contract details. Then, use that contract ID to create a final invoice for his severance pay of 7000, with the due date set to 5th July 2025. After that's done, you must terminate his contract. In parallel with the contract actions, please process his final expense reimbursement request of 350 for 'Final travel expenses'.",
