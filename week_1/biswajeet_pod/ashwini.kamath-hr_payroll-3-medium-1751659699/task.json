    "instruction": "You are Damon Bishop, administrator with user ID 'ccc6294e-c7ab-4646-822b-b34b75004466'. Today's date is 4th July, 2025. A typical work week is considered 8 hours a day, Monday through Saturday. You want to retrieve the team assignments of the worker (ID '12c65042-9718-4178-b86f-d8766fb37898') from organization 'Hart-Hernandez' (ID: 'c9358835-db5d-4ca5-bd10-2b3dde2b2e06'). First, you will check if the worker with this ID is active. Next, you will retrieve the details of the team assigned to this worker to check the details behind other team members for potential increase of virtual card limits as compensation, after which you want the summary of all of the worker's current contracts. If a contract in the 'active' status exists, you will issue a virtual card with a limit equal to a fortnight's worth of work hours multiplied by the rate given in the contract, with the provider's ID being '7b45eddd-03f6-456b-ae8c-21e590a0117e'. You will also submit a reimbursement request for 72 hours under the active contract's rate, to cover worker's relocation expenses to Serbia for training purposes. If none of the worker's current contracts are of 'active' status, you will only issue the virtual card with a limit of 2000 and provider with ID 'bf6b01bd-009c-44f3-aa8d-a57cf21b2880'.",
