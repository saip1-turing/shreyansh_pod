You want to issue an invoice to an organization for an active contract that is going to be terminated, with full-month billing applied based on rates and currency given in the respective contracts, as well as monitor the status of any unpaid invoices from the same organization. First, you will retrieve a list of all active workers under the 'Turner Group' organization with id 'd90e1ff2-84ce-4ba9-8a71-bdb6918dfb98'. You will locate the worker with the id '31b847c4-c38d-4887-8a8e-185cec6d6aab' from this list, and retrieve their team assignments, as well as a summary of all of their current contracts. You will then create the invoice only for contracts that are active, with a due-date of 15 days from today. You will then terminate this contract, effective immediately after the invoice is issued. Finally, you will retrieve the status of different invoices under the same organization, including the one you just issued.",
