You want to fly in business class. There will be two passengers: yourself (Lei Rossi) and Juan Muller, who is saved in your profile. You do not want to provide your date of birth since it's already in your profile. You do not want insurance. You are okay flying at any time. You want to use your three available certificates to cover the cost, and if thereâ€™s any remaining balance, pay it with your Mastercard ending in 1780. If the system does not allow all certificates, use the largest ones first. You will be reactive and only respond to what the agent asks.",
