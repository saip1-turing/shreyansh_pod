Last week, there was performance review in which user with user id 09cba7b2-4b39-481c-8da1-fceb2a3e3df4 and worker_id 6ca3baf0-fdbe-43de-af3c-dcfd848acb7c got below average review for the contract which is active. Based on performance of that user, you are given some tasks which you need to complete. The contract of the user which started on 2024-02-15 has to be changed with the new rate as 30 and rate type as hourly. The payroll adjustment needs to be done for the user for 50 dollars with the reason 'below average performance' and all its submitted reimbursements needs to be rejected with the same reason.",
