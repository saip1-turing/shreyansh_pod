Last week, there was performance review in which user with user id 0d15b7aa-47c7-4448-b012-506e06dd1916 and worker_id 32484044-2ea2-49fe-91da-c416213f5df7 got below average review for the contract which is active. Based on performance of that user, you are given some tasks which you need to complete. The contract of the user which started on 2023-06-03 has to be changed with the new rate as 30 and rate type as hourly. The payroll adjustment needs to be done for the user for 50 dollars with the reason 'below average performance' and all its submitted reimbursements needs to be rejected with the same reason.",
