Performance Report (ID: 1003) - Details the investor's performance history\n\nThese reports have been generated as of today (October 1, 2025) and cover the relevant period. The reports are currently in \"pending\" status and will be completed shortly.\n\nI also checked for any audit trails, notifications, or other system activities related to this investor and their cancelled subscription, but there don't appear to be any additional records in the system at this time.\n\nWould you like me to take any additional steps with these reports or do you need any other information for your investigation?"
