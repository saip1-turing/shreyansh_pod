I verified your authorization to update instrument prices, which was confirmed.\n3. I created a new price record for RRS4 (instrument ID: 49) with the following values:\n   - Date: October 5, 2025\n   - Open Price: $120.00\n   - High Price: $122.00\n   - Low Price: $119.50\n   - Close Price: $120.50\n\nThe new price record has been successfully created with ID 2478. This price data will now be used for accurate NAV calculations and portfolio valuations for the Green-Wright Growth Fund.\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to help you with regarding the fund or any other investment management activities?"
