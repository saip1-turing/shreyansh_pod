The system will validate both approvals before allowing the fund creation to proceed.\n\nWhen you're ready to proceed, you'll need to provide:\n- The requester's email (who is coordinating this)\n- Confirmation that both the Fund Manager and Compliance Officer have provided their approvals\n\nOnce both approvals are validated, we can then use the manipulate_fund tool to create your \"Alpha Strategic Hedge Fund\" with the appropriate fund type \"hedge_funds\".\n\nWould you like to proceed with validating these approvals now?
