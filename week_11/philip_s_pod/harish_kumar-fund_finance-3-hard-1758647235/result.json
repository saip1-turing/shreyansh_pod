No problem - we can wait until you have both the necessary approvals and your user ID to proceed with the fund registration.\n\nTo summarize what we'll need when you're ready to register the 'Alpha Strategic Hedge Fund':\n1. Your user ID as the fund manager\n2. Compliance officer approval\n3. Fund name: 'Alpha Strategic Hedge Fund'\n4. Fund type: hedge fund\n5. Initial fund size: $50,000,000 USD\n6. Base currency: USD\n\nOnce you have both approvals and your user ID, please come back and we can complete the registration process. The compliance officer approval is an important regulatory requirement to ensure all funds are properly authorized before creation in our system.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?"

We need both fund manager approval and compliance officer approval for the fund creation\n3. We need your user ID to link the fund to your profile\n\nRecording the NAV is an important step, but it can only be done after the fund has been officially registered in our system. The NAV record needs to be associated with a specific fund ID, which will be generated when we create the fund.\n\nI recommend focusing on obtaining the compliance officer approval and your user ID first. Once we have those and can create the fund, we'll be able to record the initial NAV value.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about the NAV recording process for when we're ready to do that step?"
