Here are the current details:\n\n- Fund ID: 3\n- Name: Rivas-Kelley Income Fund\n- Type: Private Equity Fund\n- Current Size: $356,209,360.83\n- Status: Open\n- Manager ID: 108\n\nSince you're interested in managing this existing fund, we'll need to update the manager ID to your user ID. Before I can make this change, I'll need to verify your authorization to manage this fund.\n\nCould you please confirm if you have the necessary approvals to take over management of this fund? As this requires both Fund Manager and Compliance Officer approvals, I'll need to know if these have been secured."

Obtain explicit approval from Compliance Officer Jerry Robinson for you to take over management of the Rivas-Kelley Income Fund.\n\n2.
