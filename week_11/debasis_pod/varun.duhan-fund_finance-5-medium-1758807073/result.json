However, the system has indicated that \"brianhumphrey591@finance.com\" was not found as a valid user ID in our database.\n\nSince I cannot proceed with an invalid user ID, I recommend:\n\n1. Double-checking with your system administrator to confirm your correct user ID\n2. Verifying if there might be a different format for your user ID (perhaps just \"brianhumphrey591\" without the domain)\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot bypass this validation as the user ID is a required field for document uploads, and the system must verify the uploader's identity for security and audit purposes.\n\nOnce you have confirmed your correct user ID, please let me know, and I'll be happy to proceed with the document upload."
