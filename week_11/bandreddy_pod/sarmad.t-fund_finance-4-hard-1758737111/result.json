Both are active and ready for transaction processing.\n\nRegarding the compliance approval process for this $2.5 million investment commitment:\n\n1. **Compliance Officer Approval Required**: As this is a significant investment commitment, it requires explicit approval from a Compliance Officer before we can record it in the system.\n\n2. **Next Steps for Compliance Approval**:\n   - The Compliance Officer needs to review and verify the investor's accreditation status (which I can see is already marked as \"accredited\" in our system)\n   - The Compliance Officer must confirm the source of funds is legitimate (our records show \"dividend_income\")\n   - The Compliance Officer will need to formally approve this specific commitment transaction\n\n3. **What You Need to Do**:\n   - Contact your designated Compliance Officer to request approval for this $2.5 million commitment\n   - Provide them with the investor details (Sampson-Foley, ID: 6) and fund details (Brown-Wall Balanced Fund, ID: 9)\n   - Once approved, you'll need to confirm that approval with me so I can record the commitment\n\n4. **Information Needed to Record the Commitment**:\n   - Investor ID: 6 (Sampson-Foley)\n   - Fund ID: 9 (Brown-Wall Balanced Fund)\n   - Commitment amount: $2,500,000\n   - Commitment date: To be confirmed by you\n   - Compliance Officer approval: To be confirmed\n\nWould you like me to proceed with recording this commitment once you have the compliance approval and commitment date confirmed?"
