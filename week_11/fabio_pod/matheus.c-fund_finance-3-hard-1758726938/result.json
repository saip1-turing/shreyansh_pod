This means we need to create a new investor profile before we can process any investment.\n\nFor regulatory compliance and security reasons, I need some basic information about the investor to create their profile:\n- A contact email address\n- The source of funds for this investment\n- Whether the investor is accredited or non-accredited\n\nOnce we have this information and create the investor profile, we can then process the investment of $4,337,090.04 USD into the Hudson-Barnett Value Fund with your compliance officer approval.\n\nCould you please provide these details so I can help you complete this process?"
