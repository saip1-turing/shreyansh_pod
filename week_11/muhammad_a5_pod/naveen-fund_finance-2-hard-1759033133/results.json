Instead, funds are created with a \"created_at\" timestamp which is automatically set to the current date when the fund record is established in the system.\n\nThe fund's operational status (open or closed) can be managed after creation. A fund with a \"closed\" status wouldn't accept new investments regardless of any future date you might have in mind.\n\nOnce you have Richard Bass's user ID and the Compliance Officer's approval, we can create the fund with the name \"Crescent Growth Fund\", base currency USD, and it will be managed by Richard Bass. If you need the fund to be inactive until October 1, 2025, we could create it with a \"closed\" status and then update it to \"open\" on your desired activation date.\n\nWould you like me to help you with anything else regarding the fund setup process?"

Setting the fund's status to \"open\" upon creation and managing status changes internally as needed is perfectly reasonable.\n\nTo ensure a smooth setup once you have all the necessary approvals and details, here's what you should prepare:\n\n1. **Fund Manager ID**: Obtain Richard Bass's specific user ID in our system\n2. **Compliance Officer Approval**: Secure formal approval from a designated Compliance Officer\n3. **Fund Details Confirmation**:\n   - Fund name: \"Crescent Growth Fund\"\n   - Fund type: hedge fund (this will be specified during creation)\n   - Base currency: USD\n   - Initial fund manager: Richard Bass\n   - Status: open (as you requested)\n\nOnce you have these items ready, the fund creation process will be straightforward. The system will automatically generate a unique fund ID upon creation, and you'll be able to access the fund record immediately after creation.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the fund setup process or any other aspects of fund management that I can help you with?"
