Setting a future effective date like October 1, 2025 isn't supported by the standard fund creation process. The fund would need to be created with an \"open\" status right away, and then potentially managed through other means if you need it to remain inactive until that date.\n\nTo proceed with creating the Crescent Growth Fund, I'll need the actual user ID for Richard Bass (not just the name). Could you please provide that specific ID? Once I have it, I can help create the fund as a hedge fund with USD as the base currency."
