Having just returned from your holidays, you reviewed your ToDo list, which includes several tasks assigned by the directors. First, you need to confirm whether your virtual card, with a limit of approximately 9611 NOK, was blocked during your holiday period, as it was not intended to be used at that time. Next, one of your workers, who works for a company based in Norway operating on the Australia/Sydney timezone, must be assigned as lead of the MarketingAdvanced team on 2025-07-12, since there is currently no lead and the document indicates that two members in the team require guidance to operate smoothly in the coming weeksâ€”you need to verify whether the team indeed consists of two members. Additionally, another worker from your team, currently engaged at Ferguson-Peterson (organization ID: 2e786155-9aad-4686-93c5-901ed1a4b4ec), needs to be transitioned to a different organization due to unexpected project delays. The new assignment should be at Wolfe, Weber and Nguyen in Sweden, where the project is at its peak and requires significant manpower, ensuring that the time zone remains unchanged.",
