However, upon review, you have determined that the requested amount is incorrect and plan to reject the reimbursement request on this basis. After performing the rejection, you will retrieve the reimbursement status to ensure that the changes have been accurately reflected. Subsequently, you want to update the contract pay terms for this member, who belongs to the same organization as yours, setting their pay rate to 98000 with an annual rate type Finally, you intend to adjust the reimbursement correctly by adding it as a payroll item with the accurate amount of 350.88 and will then validate their payroll summary to confirm all updates are in alignment. You will stay in a reactive state during this workflow, responding only when prompted and refraining from offering unsolicited updates.",
