        "instruction": "You are Erik Smith, an admin with user ID 'aaf31b45-2558-41b8-a1f6-7058b557d316'. Today is 7th July, 2025. You want to issue a new invoice to a parent company (organization ID: '2e00a413-d33e-4cf4-9019-db4b5c9694b2') for a payroll item covered by its subsidiary company, an issue that has long since been causing disruption between both companies. First you want to find the ID of this subsidiary that is located in Italy with the timezone set to Europe/Helsinki. You then want to list out the current statuses of the invoices made by this company, and ensure that none of them are issued to the worker with ID 'bfb02ec2-76d3-4606-be76-4a6b56d2d412', so that there is no confusion regarding whether the bills have already been covered by the parent company. Next, you will request for any existing payroll runs from this organization that were made in pounds and processed successfully. If any such payroll run exists, you will request for a full breakdown behind any items under the payroll run that were paid for in GBP. You will mark the amount paid for this payroll item to be the same in the invoice, and the due date to be 15 days from today. Finally, you will: \n\n 1. get the worker and organization details of user with ID 'f144437d-b0e8-489f-8786-a34bb1c8af54' \n\n 2. Confirm their worker ID matches the ID 'bfb02ec2-76d3-4606-be76-4a6b56d2d412' to avoid reimbursing the wrong worker. \n\n 3. Get their current contract details using their worker ID\n\n 4. Issue a virtual card to this user with a limit equal to three times the rate of their current active contract (regardless of rate type) in the same currency as said contract, as compensation for the payroll misalignment and confusion caused. Set the provider's ID as '2697b4ce-e73c-404f-b66b-b33154e510e9'. \n\n 5. Include this worker's ID in the invoice as a reference contact as well.",
