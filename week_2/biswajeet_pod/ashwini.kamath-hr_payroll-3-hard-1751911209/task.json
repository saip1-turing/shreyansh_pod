You have been trying to resolve payroll-related conflicts involving invoices for three different employees under the same organization by issuing compensation for those involved. This organization is located in Germany and is operating in the Europe/Berlin time zone. From the invoices that were issued and not paid by this organization in 'NOK' or 'SEK' currency, you would like to get the related workers' identification, confirm if they are involved in active contracts, and go through the details behind their assigned teams. If the active worker is not assigned to any team, you will make sure they receive a reimbursement with an amount equal to the value in their associated invoice, in the same currency, to cover relocation travel costs. You would then want to have the associated invoice for those who will receive reimbursements be updated to paid status.",
